![Nake](Logo.Wide.png)

Nake is a magic task runner tool for .NET. It's a hybrid of Shovel and Rake. The DSL for defining tasks is uniquely minimal and it's just plain (_naked_) C# code! Nake is built on top of the latest Roslyn release so you can use all of the latest C# features in your scripts and even more.

**Requirements:**
- .NET 8.0 SDK (8.0.12 or later recommended)
- Supports C# 12 language features

### How to install

Nake is built as dotnet tool. You can install it either globally or [locally](https://stu.dev/dotnet-core-3-local-tools/) (recommended):

	PM> dotnet tool install Nake

**Prerequisites:** Ensure you have .NET 8.0 SDK installed. Nake leverages C# 12 language features and requires .NET 8.0 runtime.

        [Task] void Clean()         //     then from the command line you would invoke

[Nake] void Default() => Build();   //          running Nake without any options 
                                    //       will cause it to run the "default" task
```

## Command line reference

General syntax is: `Nake [options ...]  [VAR=VALUE ...]  [task ...]`

```cs
> Nake -f "Nake.csx" Log=1 build    //       set Log environment variable to 1 and
                                    //      then run Build() task from Nake.csx file 
                                        
> Nake Log=1 build                  //  equivalent to the above as Nake will automatically try 
                                    //   to use Nake.csx file if present in current directory
```

### Making scripts executable

Nake scripts can be made directly executable with a polyglot shebang 
(just make sure you've installed Nake as dotnet tool either globally or locally):

```cs
#!/usr/bin/env bash
//usr/bin/true; exec dotnet nake "$@"; exit
/**/
#r "nuget: Nake.Meta, 3.0.0"
// ... rest of your script
```

Then just `chmod +x Nake.csx` and run with `./Nake.csx [task]`

Options:

	   -?  --help             Display help message and exit
	   -v  --version          Display the program version and exit
	   -q  --quiet            Do not echo informational messages to standard output
	   -s  --silent           Same as --quiet but also suppresses user generated log messages
	   -f  --nakefile FILE    Use FILE as Nake project file
	   -d  --directory DIR    Use DIR as current directory
	   -t  --trace            Enables full stack traces in error reporting + task execution trace
	       --debug            Enables full script debugging in Visual Studio
	   -T  --tasks [PATTERN]  Display tasks with descriptions matching optional PATTERN and exit
	   -r  --reset-cache      Resets compilation output cache

### Invoking tasks

General syntax for invoking tasks and passing arguments is similar to the normal C# method invocation syntax, except ` ` is used instead of `,` to separate task arguments, and `=` is used instead of `:` for specifying named argument values. Also, boolean arguments support special `--` switch syntax.

```cs
> Nake build                          //  run Build task with default arg values
> Nake build Release                  //  or with first positional argument set to 'Release'
> Nake build cfg=Release              //  or with named argument 'cfg' set to 'Release'
> Nake build Release outDir="/c/Tmp"  //  you can mix positional and named arguments
> Nake build ; test                   //  or invoke multiple tasks within a same session
> Nake build `; test                  //  also escape ';' when running in PowerShell console 
> Nake publish --beta                 //  invoke Publish task with 'beta' arg set to 'true'
```

## Included utility reference

Out-of-the box Nake includes a lot of useful convinient utility functions to help you with: 

- running external tools, such as command-line commands or MSBuild
- selecting and transforming file system paths (globber)
- casual file system tasks, such as copying, moving, deleting files/folders 
- logging messages to console
- working with environment variables
- controlling Nake's runner
- etc

## Tips & tricks

```cs
class Azure
{                                       
    StorageAccount account;
    
    static Azure()                  //  this will run once before any of the 
    {                               //  tasks in this namespace are executed
        account = Init();           //  (useful for one-off initialization)
    }
}

## Contributing

Make sure you follow the coding guidelines which exists on a project (either as R# formatting settings or .editorconfig). Nothing else)

## Samples and Documentation

Have a look at [Nake.csx](https://github.com/yevhen/Nake/blob/master/Nake.csx). It's a Nake file used to build and publish Nake itself (ye, we're eating our own dog food).

General discussion group could be found [here](https://gitter.im/yevhen/Nake). Also, for news you can follow Nake's [official](https://twitter.com/NakeTool) twitter account (or [my](https://twitter.com/yevhen) account for that matter). The twitter's hashtag is `#naketool`.

## Credits
- Thanks to everyone in the Roslyn compiler team for making this happen
- Thanks to everyone in the dotnet-script team
- Thanks to MedallionShell community for the great project
- Special thanks to Anton Martynenko for giving me an idea and steering Nake's DSL in the right direction
- Hugs and kisses to my lovely Valery for being so patient and supportive, and for feeding me food and beer, while I was sitting in my cage working on Nake, instead of spending that time with her
